    "# Using the surveydata package with ODK Central\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook demonstrates how to use the `surveydata` Python package to work with [ODK Central](https://docs.getodk.org/central-intro/) data. It demonstrates four different approaches to storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use of local data exported by [ODK Central](https://docs.getodk.org/central-intro/)\n",
    "2. Synchronizing data directly from ODK into the local file system\n",
    "3. Synchronizing data directly from ODK into [AWS S3 storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), including attachments\n",
    "4. Synchronizing data directly from ODK into [AWS DynamoDB storage](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), with attachments saved to AWS S3\n",
    "5. Synchronizing data directly from ODK into [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), including attachments\n",
    "6. Synchronizing data directly from ODK into [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/), including attachments\n",
    "\n",
    "All examples other than the local data export include code to save and reload Pandas DataFrames, for cases where data ingestion and processing is separated from actual analysis or use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading credentials and configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This example workbook begins by loading cloud storage configuration and credentials from an `.ini` file stored in `~/.ocl/surveydata-odk-examples.ini`. The `~` in the path refers to the current user's home directory, and the `.ini` file contents are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [aws]\n",
    "    accesskeyid=idhere\n",
    "    accesskeysecret=secrethere\n",
    "    s3bucketname=bucketnamehere\n",
    "    region=regionnamehere\n",
    "    ddbtablename=tablenamehere\n",
    "\n",
    "    [google]\n",
    "    googleprojectid=idhere\n",
    "    googlebucketname=bucketnamehere\n",
    "\n",
    "    [azure]\n",
    "    azureconnectionstring=connectionstringhere\n",
    "    azurecontainername=oclexamples\n",
    "    azureaccounturl=https://storageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to update the path in `inifile_location` below, and only include properties as needed for the example cases you wish to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ODK Central credentials are likewise loaded from `~/.ocl/.pyodk_config.toml`, which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [central]\n",
    "    base_url = \"https://yourserver.domain.com\"\n",
    "    username = \"username_with_access\"\n",
    "    password = \"password\"\n",
    "    default_project_id = default_project_id_number\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for Google Cloud authentication, service account credentials are loaded from `~/.ocl/google-ocl-examples-service-account-credentials.json`, which can be saved directly from the Google Cloud Storage console."
