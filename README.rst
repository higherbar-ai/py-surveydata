The ``surveydata`` Python package offers flexible access to survey data and support for
multiple local and cloud storage options.

Installation
------------

Installing the latest version with pip::

    pip install surveydata

Overview
--------

To use the ``surveydata`` package, you access data from specific survey platforms via an
appropriate ``SurveyPlatform`` object:

* ``SurveyCTOPlatform`` provides support for `SurveyCTO <https://www.surveycto.com>`_ data,
  including `text audits <https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/01-core-concepts/03zd.field-types-text-audit.html>`_
* *Support for more survey platforms is coming!* Reach out if you have a particular need or
  are willing to contribute.

All survey data must be stored somewhere, and storage is handled via an appropriate
``StorageSystem`` object:

* ``FileStorage`` provides support for local file storage
* ``S3Storage`` provides support for `AWS S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_ storage
* ``DynamoDBStorage`` provides support `AWS DynamoDB <https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/>`_ storage
* ``SurveyCTOExportStorage`` provides support for local exports from `SurveyCTO Desktop <https://docs.surveycto.com/05-exporting-and-publishing-data/02-exporting-data-with-surveycto-desktop/01.using-desktop.html>`_
* *Support for more storage systems is coming!* Reach out if you have a particular need or
  are willing to contribute.

In general, the workflow goes like this:

#. Initialize the survey platform
#. Initialize one or more storage systems
#. Synchronize data between the survey platform and the storage system(s) to ensure that
   data in storage is fully up-to-date
#. Load data and/or attachments via the survey platform and storage API's

(When using a static data export for storage, via a class like ``SurveyCTOExportStorage``,
the *synchronize* step is skipped, but otherwise everything is the same.)

For convenience, the repo includes ``.idea`` project files for PyCharm.

To rebuild the documentation:

#. For the first time:
    a. ``pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme``
#. Update version number in ``/docs/source/conf.py``
#. Update layout or options as needed in ``/docs/source/index.rst``
#. In a terminal window, from the project directory:
    a. ``cd docs``
    b. ``SPHINX_APIDOC_OPTIONS=members,show-inheritance sphinx-apidoc -o source ../src/surveydata --separate --force``
    c. ``make clean html``

To rebuild the distribution packages:

#. For the first time:
    a. ``pip install setuptools twine``
#. For the PyPI package:
    a. Update version number (and any build options) in ``/setup.py``
    b. Confirm credentials and settings in ``~/.pypirc``
    c. Run ``/setup.py`` for ``bdist_wheel`` and/or ``sdist`` build types (*Tools... Run setup.py task...* in PyCharm)
    d. Delete old builds from ``/dist``
    e. In a terminal window:
        i. ``twine upload dist/* --verbose``
#. For GitHub:
    a. Commit everything to GitHub and merge to ``main`` branch
    b. Add new release, linking to new tag like ``v#.#.#`` in main branch
#. For readthedocs.io:
    a. Go to https://readthedocs.org/projects/surveydata/, log in, and click to rebuild from GitHub
